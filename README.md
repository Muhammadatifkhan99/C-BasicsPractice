# College C++ Basics

This is a collection of basic C++ code that I wrote during my time in college. These programs cover a range of topics, from simple data types to loops and conditional statements.

### Getting Started
To run these programs, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. You can use a command-line compiler like g++ or clang, or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.

Once you have a compiler set up, simply navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run and use the appropriate compiler command to compile and run the program. For example, to compile and run `hello_world.cpp` using g++, you would run the following commands in your terminal:


## Code
``` 
g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
./hello_world 
```


### Program List
`hello_world.cpp`: A simple "Hello, world!" program.

`data_types.cpp`: Demonstrates the use of different data types in C++, such as int, double, and bool.

`if_else.cpp`: Shows how to use conditional statements (if-else statements) to control program flow.

`loops.cpp`: Demonstrates different types of loops in C++, including for, while, and do-while loops.
